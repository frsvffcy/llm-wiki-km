# llm-wiki-km

A local-first personal knowledge base built with Java 21 and Spring Boot.

## Prerequisites

- Java 21
- Maven 3.9+

## Build and test

```bash
mvn clean test
mvn clean package
```

## Run

```bash
java -jar target/llm-wiki-km-0.1.0.jar
```

The application listens only on `127.0.0.1:8765` by default.

## System status

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1/system/status
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "status": "READY",
    "version": "0.1.0"
  }
}
```

SQLite and Flyway dependencies are included in the application skeleton. Their runtime configuration and migrations are intentionally deferred to the dedicated persistence stories.
